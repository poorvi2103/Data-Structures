                                                        //RED BLACK TREE

red black tree is basically bst
red black tre is height alanced bst
red black  is roughly height balanced while avl is strictly height balanced
sometimes in avl,rotations can be more to balance thr tree but in case of red black,rotations WILL be less and sometimes in red black,just recolouring is enough to balance the tree.
AVL tree is better in case of searching while red black is better in case of insertion and deletion.
