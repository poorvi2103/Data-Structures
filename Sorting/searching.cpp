kSEARCHING:
	1.Linear search  transposition approach and move to first approach(swap element with first element)
	                          to improve linear search (applicable if want to search famous element,swap element with previous one)
	                        time complexity:
					best case= O(1)
					worst case=O(n)
					unsuccessful search=O(n)
	
	
	
	2.binary search:  elements should be in sorted order
				time complexity:
					best case= O(1)
					worst case=log 2 base n
					unsuccessful search=log 2 base n
					
					
					
					
for linked list,linear search is suitable than binary search coz in ll ,middle finding is difficult.
but in array,binary search is more suitable.
