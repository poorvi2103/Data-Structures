if there are any vertics in graph whose removal splits the graph into some components,then such vertices are known as articulation vertices.

Directed Graph:	( also known as diagraphdigraph)
				if the edges in graph have directions,then it is known as directed graph
				if in directed graph ,if there is age connecting to same vertex ,then it is known as self loop.
				the no.of edges that are coming in to a vertex ,is known as indegree of a vertex
				No.of edges that are going out of a vertex is called out degree of a vertex.
				A directed graph which does not contain swlf loop and parallel eges is known as simple digraph.
				In a directed graph ,if you are starting from any vertex, and if we can reach to another vertices,then it is known as
				strongly connectrd digraph.
				
If two vertices are connected by edge ,then these verttices are called as adjacent vertices.
In undirected graph,internally all edges are parallel.
Path means set of all edges betwwn a pair of vertices.
If there is a path which is starting and ending at the same vertex, that means that graph contains cycle.

Directed Acyclic Graph:
	a directed graph which does not contains any cycle is known as directed acyclic graph.
	
Representation Of Graph:
	1.Adjacency Matrix
	2.Adjacency List
	3.Compact List
	
	
	
Every tree is a graph.
but every graph is not tree.
 
 
Graph with no cycle is tree.
bsf in graph is similar to levelorder traversal of tree.
dfs is similar to  preorderj
graph can have multiple bsf.
