//Dijkstra Algoritm :  Greedy Algorithm(i.e.have fix procedue)[while in dynamic, we take lot of decesions at varioussteps]

Applicabe for both directdand non directed(can cnnvert non directed to directed,by parallel edges)
This algo is for single source shortest path.(i.egives shortest path from single source to every node)
time complexity: n*n ,n=no.of nodes
 
Weight ofgraph can be positive or negative.

drawback:
	don't work properly for negative weighted graph
